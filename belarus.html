                                                    It is a land with ancient history. The first settlements appeared on the territory of modern Belarus in the 6th and 7th centuries. Over its history different parts of Belarus comprised different countries: Kievan Rus, The Great Dutchy of Lithuania, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian Empire, Poland, the USSR.
                                                    In July 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Republic passed the Declaration of Independence. Since then Belarus has been an independent democratic country complying with human rights and freedoms.</p>

The patience and peacefulness of the Belarusian people has been determined by the nation’s history that has been darkened by endless wars which the Belarusians did not start, but fell victim to.
                                                    Belarus is welcoming to all visitors and interested in sharing its culture, traditions and sense of community with them.</p><br>
